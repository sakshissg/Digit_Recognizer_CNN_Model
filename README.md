# Digit_Recognizer_CNN_Model
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from grayscale images. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in digit classification. The dataset consists of thousands of 28x28 pixel images, each labeled with the correct digit.
